# alg-and-data-structures-2-project
A project for my 'algorithm and data structures 2' module in college.

***3 parts to the program:***
  1) Finding the shortest path between 2 stops passed by user
  2) Finding stops that match a name passed by user
  3) Finding trips that correspond to a passed arrival time
