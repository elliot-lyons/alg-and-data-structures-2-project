# alg-and-data-structures-2-project
A project that I'm doing as part of algorithm and data structures 2 module.

3 parts to the program:
  1) - Finding the shortest path between 2 stops
  2) - Finding stops that match a name passed by user
  3) - Finding trips that correspond to a passed arrival time
